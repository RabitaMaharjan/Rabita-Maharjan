# ` Introduction of myself `

# I'am > Rabita Maharjan. I am 32 years old woman from Nepal, came to belgium in 2015 because of earthquake that happened in the same year in my home country. It took me one and half year to get recognization in belgium, then after I started to learn Dutch for a while and started simple job to help my family financiallyas it was not possible to get job according to my degree from my country because of the language barrier. It's not easy journey to come to a different country by leaving everything behind and start again from the beginning. But on the other hand it gives opportunities to learn new things everyday and helps ourselves to evolve.
